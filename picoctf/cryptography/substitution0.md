This room is quite simple! (It uses a substitution cipher for encryption.)

You'll find the substitution alphabet "ZGSOCXPQUYHMILERVTBWNAFJDK" in the first line of the downloaded file.

Head over to Cryptii, enter the ciphertext along with the given substitution alphabet...

And just like thatâ€”boom! You've got the flag! ðŸŽ¯
